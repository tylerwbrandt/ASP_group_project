List of Functions in the gaussianComparisons Package 

cleaner(dataset)
  Returns: A dataframe, with each row containing information about one comparison.
  Other Functions Used: NONE 
  Other Notes:  Input 'dataset' should be of format identical to that of "exampleHITs.csv".
                This function is called in other functions to clean the dataset into a workable format. 
  
omega(dataset, sigma)
  Returns: The omega matrix (each element in the matrix is calculated using Equation 1.5), a matrix. 
  Other Functions Used: cleaner 

gPrior(omega)
  Returns: The prior on the unknown vector g (Equation 1), a vector.
  Other Functions Used: NONE
  Other Notes:  This function is called in newtonMethod to find g_hat, which is then used in ________
  
dLogPri(omega, g)
  Returns: The derivative of the log prior function (Equation 4), a vector.
  Other Functions Used: NONE
  
d2LogPri(omega, g)
  Returns: The second derivative of the log prior function (Equation 5), a matrix.
  Other Functions Used: NONE
  
logLike(g, y)
  Returns: The log-likelihood function (Equation 5.9), a scalar. 
  Other Functions Used: NONE
  Other Notes:  y is a vector of 1s and -1s, representing the results of each comparison.
  
dLogLike(g, y)
  Returns: The derivative of the log-likelihood function (Equation 6), a vector. 
  Other Functions Used: NONE

d2LogLike(g, y)
  Returns: The second derivative of the log-likelihood function (Equation 7), a matrix. 
  Other Functions Used: dLogLike
  
dPsi(omega, g, y)
  Returns: The derivative of the log of the numerator of the full posterior equation (Equation 8), a vector.
  Other Functions Used: dLogPri, dLogLike
  
d2Psi(omega, g, y)
  Returns: The second derivative of the log of the numerator of the full posterior equation (Equation 9), a matrix.
  Other Functions Used: d2LogLike, d2LogPri

newtonMethodPrequel(omega, g, y)
  Returns: The third and last term of the Newton's Method equation (third term of Equation 9.5), a vector.
  Other Functions Used: dPsi, d2Psi
  Other Notes:  This function will be called in the newtonMethod function to find g_hat. 
  
newtonMethod(omega, y, tolerance)
  Returns: g_hat (Equation 9.5) , a vector. 
  Other Functions Used: gPrior, newtonMethodPrequel
  Other Notes:  gPrior is called in this function to find the prior on g, which is then passed into newtonMethodPrequel and                   subsequently the other functions that require g as an input.
